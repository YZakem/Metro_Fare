#pseudocode for calculating fares

Store parking and ride cost by station
  - create key of park and ride with associated costs
    - store string for park, prompt for parking cost
      - put park: cost into a key pair under station
    - store string for ride, prompt for ride cost
      - put ride: cost into a key pair under station
  - associate key with station
  
Calculate cost of each station
  - multiply cost of ride by two
  - add result plus parking
 
Estimate costs for week and month
  - multiply by 3 for week - exact
  - multiply by 13 for month - approximate

Compare cost of stations
  - find lowest price of all calculated costs
